"""A custom airflow acquisition monitor.

Wait until acquisition is done.

An acquisition is considered "done" if either:
- exactly one new file has been found
- the main file has not appeared for a certain amount of time (relevant for Bruker only)
- the file size has not changed for a certain amount of time
- (only if Airflow  variable 'consider_old_files_acquired' is set) when the file is "old" (default: > 5h) compared to the
  youngest file. This should be used with caution, but can be handy in case a catchup is required.
